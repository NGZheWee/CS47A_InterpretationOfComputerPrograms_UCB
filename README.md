# CS47A: Completion of Work in Computer Science 61A  (Fall 2023, UCB) 

This repository contains coursework from **Completion of Work in Computer Science 61A**, which I took in Fall 2023 at UC Berkeley. The course is a self-paced version of 61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) for students who have already taken a course equivalent to 61B.The course focuses on fundamental programming paradigms, abstraction mechanisms, and computational processes.

## Contents:

- **Homework**: Contains homework assignments that cover functional programming, recursion, higher-order functions, and data abstraction.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Functional Programming**: Understanding and applying functional programming techniques using Scheme and Python.
- **Recursion**: Recursive problem-solving techniques, including structural and generative recursion.
- **Data Abstraction**: Building complex data structures using abstraction techniques.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
- **Interpreter Design**: Understanding the design and implementation of interpreters for simple programming languages.

## How to Navigate:

- **Homework**: All homework assignments are located under the `Homework/` directory, each containing code and documentation on programming techniques and problem-solving strategies.


Explore the coursework to see implementations of programming paradigms and abstractions, focusing on functional programming and the interpretation of computational processes.
